        question: "Is it safe to use CipherGen for generating my passwords?",

        question: "How does CipherGen encrypt and decrypt passwords?",
        answer: "CipherGen uses symmetric encryption, where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting passwords. This ensures that your sensitive information is securely stored and only accessible by you with the correct key."
